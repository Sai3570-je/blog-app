## Tech Stack Choices and Justifications

### Frontend Technology Stack

#### React 18 with Vite
**Choice Rationale**: React was selected as the frontend framework due to its component-based architecture, extensive ecosystem, and excellent developer experience. Vite was chosen over Create React App for its superior build performance and modern development features.

**Benefits Realized**:
- Fast development server with hot module replacement
- Component reusability and maintainability
- Strong TypeScript support (though we used JavaScript for faster development)
- Excellent debugging tools and community support

#### Shadcn/ui Component Library
**Choice Rationale**: Shadcn/ui was specifically required and provides a modern, accessible component library built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Benefits Realized**:
- Consistent design system across the application
- Accessibility features built-in
- Customizable components that match modern design trends
- Reduced development time for UI components

#### Redux Toolkit for State Management
**Choice Rationale**: Redux Toolkit was chosen for its simplified Redux usage, built-in best practices, and excellent developer tools.

**Benefits Realized**:
- Predictable state management across the application
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Efficient handling of async operations with createAsyncThunk
- Centralized state for authentication, posts, and UI state

#### Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Choice Rationale**: Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling that integrates seamlessly with Shadcn/ui components.

**Benefits Realized**:
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Consistent spacing and color schemes
- Responsive design utilities
- Small bundle size with purging unused styles

### Backend Technology Stack

#### Node.js with Express.js
**Choice Rationale**: Node.js was specifically required and provides excellent performance for I/O-intensive applications like blogs. Express.js offers a minimal, flexible framework for building APIs.

**Benefits Realized**:
- JavaScript across the entire stack (full-stack JavaScript)
- Excellent performance for concurrent requests
- Rich ecosystem of middleware and packages
- Easy integration with MongoDB

#### MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
**Choice Rationale**: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling blog content, which can vary significantly in structure. Mongoose provides elegant object modeling and validation.

**Benefits Realized**:

- Excellent performance for read-heavy blog applications
- Built-in support for complex queries and aggregations
- Easy horizontal scaling capabilities

#### JWT for Authentication
**Choice Rationale**: JWT tokens provide stateless authentication that scales well and works excellently with single-page applications.

**Benefits Realized**:
- Stateless authentication (no server-side sessions)
- Secure token-based authentication
- Easy integration with frontend applications
- Support for token expiration and refresh

#### Additional Backend Technologies

**bcryptjs**: Chosen for secure password hashing with salt rounds for protection against rainbow table attacks.

**express-validator**: Provides comprehensive input validation and sanitization for API endpoints.

**Swagger/OpenAPI**: Automatically generates comprehensive API documentation for better developer experience.
